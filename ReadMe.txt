xxxxxx to calcute inverse of matrix in mixed fraction form xxxxxxx

1.To campile use linux machine 64bit with gcc and math library
2.gcc matrixInverse.c -lm
3.To run use ./a.out 
4.First line will ask for number row and column for square matrix like for 4x4 you have to put 4.
5.After that you have to put input matrix as following instruction.
6.Try to avoid more space between two input in same row.
7.Row should be end with ";" like for 3 x 3 matrix
   		1 2 3;
   		4 5 6;
   		7 8 9;
8.Put your matrix ... or you can chose from file testdata.txt
9.Tested matrix and output is written in file testdata.txt
9.If determinant of matrix in  0 (zero) than it will show "Determinant Of Matrix is ZERO inverse not possible"
